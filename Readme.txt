This is my coursework for Networked Software Development. 
Within this folder you can find:

- The libraries used in the program, located under /assignment_supplements/lib/
- The .JAR files for the program under /src/org/nsd 
- The .Class files for the program under /out/production/NSD Coursework/org/nsd/

I have also implemented both message persistance (Using SQLlite)
and message retrival (Get Requests).

To run the program in Intellij first Run the Server, then load up as many clients
as you want. Ensure that you have enabled "Allow multiple instances" in Intellij's
configuration settings
